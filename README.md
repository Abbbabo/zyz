# Agriculture-Web-Application
Getting affected by a disease is very common in plants due to various factors such as fertilizers, cultural practices followed, environmental conditions, etc. These diseases hurt agricultural yield and eventually the economy based on it. 

Any technique or method to overcome this problem and getting a warning before the plants are infected would aid farmers to efficiently cultivate crops or plants, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Thus, disease detection in plants plays a very important role in agriculture.

In this web Application you can check the diseases of maize, potato, tomato, cotton, grapes and also you can check what crops you need to grow in your land by giving a little information about your land here so you can get a good yield by taking the right crop in that land at the right time

Deep neural networks has been highly successful in image classification problems. In this Project, we have used CNN that can recognize the plant diseases of Plant images. We have used publicly available datasets. Hence, the problem that we have addressed is a multi class classification problem. We compared different architectures including VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, InceptionV3, as the backbones for our work. We found that VGG19,InceptionV3 achieves the best result on the test set.
